The goal for this The Odin Project is to create an admin dashboard.

The dashboard is meant to display a layout containing a sidebar, navigation and main content sections. 

This project required the use of HTML and CSS only.

In order to properly format this project, the use of both grid and flexbox properties were necessary. 

Grid was used to set the overall layout at each level. Flexbox was used to align elements among singular axis.

The website hosting the form was published via Github and can be accessed using the following link:
